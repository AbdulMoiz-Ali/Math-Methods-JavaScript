      <h1>-: Rounding numbers :-</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        You run an online music service where customers rate each song. You
        aggregate all the <br />
        customer ratings and average them, awarding a song from zero to five
        stars. Usually, averaging <br />
        produces a fraction. You need to round it to the nearest integer so you
        can translate the number <br />
        into stars. Suppose the average has been assigned to the variable
        scoreAvg. Here's the code <br />
        that rounds it to the nearest integer. <br />
        var numberOfStars = Math.round(scoreAvg); <br />
        <br />
        Things to keep in mind: <br />
        Math. is how all math functions begin. The "M" must be capped. <br />
        The function rounds up when the decimal is .5. It rounds 1.5 to 2, 2.5
        to 3, etc. It rounds - <br />
        1.5 to -1, -2.5 to -2, etc. <br />
        When the result is assigned to a new variable, as in the example above,
        the unrounded <br />
        number enclosed in parentheses is preserved. But you can assign the
        rounded number to the <br />
        original variable, and the unrounded number will be replaced by the
        rounded number. <br />
        scoreAvg = Math.round(scoreAvg); <br />
        Instead of a variable, you can enclose a literal number in the
        parentheses. <br />
        <br />
        var scoreAvg = Math.round(.0678437); <br />
        To force JavaScript to round up to the nearest integer, no matter how
        small the fraction, <br />
        use ceil instead of round. The following code rounds .000001, which
        would normally round <br />
        down to 0, up to the nearest integer, 1. <br />
        var scoreAvg = Math.ceil(.000001); <br />
        ceil stands for "ceiling." It rounds .000001 up to 1, -.000001 up to 0,
        1.00001 up to 2, <br />
        and so on. <br />
        To force JavaScript to round down to the nearest integer, no matter how
        large the <br />
        fraction, use floor instead of round. The following code rounds .999999,
        which would <br />
        normally round up to 1, down to 0. <br />
        var scoreAvg = Math.floor(.999999); <br />
        floor rounds .999999 down to 0, 1.9 down to 1, -.000001 down to -1, and
        so on. <br />

      <h1>-: Generating random numbers :-</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        Suppose you want to simulate the throw of a die. In the simulation, you
        want it to <br />
        randomly come up 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The first step is to ask
        JavaScript to generate a random <br />
        number. (Well, it's almost random, technically known as pseudo-random,
        but it's close enough <br />
        to random for most purposes.) <br />
        The following code generates a pseudo-random number, with 16 decimal
        places, ranging <br />
        from 0.0000000000000000 through 0.9999999999999999 and assigns it to the
        variable <br />
        randomNumber. <br />
        var randomNumber = Math.random(); <br />
        The function always delivers a 16-place decimal that ranges from
        0.0000000000000000 <br />
        to 0.9999999999999999. We can convert the decimal to an integer by
        multiplying by one <br />
        hundred quadrillion (1 followed by 17 zeroes): <br />
        0.0000000000000000 * 100000000000000000 = 0 <br />
        0.7474887706339359 * 100000000000000000 = 7474887706339359 <br />
        0.9999999999999999 * 100000000000000000 = 9999999999999999 <br />
        Trillions of possible numbers are more than we need in our virtual die
        throw. We just <br />
        want six possible numbers, 1 through 6. So instead of multiplying by a
        hundred quadrillion, our <br />
        first step is to multiply the giant decimal by 6. <br />
        0.0000000000000000 * 6 = 0 <br />
        0.7474887706339359 * 6 = 4.7474887706339359 <br />
        0.9999999999999999 * 6 = 5.9999999999999994 <br />
        Intuition may tell you that you can finish the job by rounding, but that
        doesn't work out <br />
        mathematically. Because nothing rounds up to 0 and nothing rounds down
        to 6, the numbers in <br />
        the middle, which are reached both by rounding up and rounding down,
        will come up almost <br />
        twice as often. But we can give all the numbers an equal chance if we
        add 1 to the result, then <br />
        round down. Here's the code for our virtual die throw. <br />
        1 var bigDecimal = Math.random(); <br />
        2 var improvedNum = (bigDecimal * 6) + 1; <br />
        3 var numberOfStars = Math.floor(improvedNum); <br />
        This is what happens in the code above, line by line: <br />
        1. Generates a 16-place decimal and assigns it to the variable
        bigDecimal. <br />
        2. Converts the 16-place decimal to a number ranging from
        0.0000000000000000 through <br />
        5.9999999999999999, then adds 1, so the range winds up
        1.0000000000000000 through <br />
        6.9999999999999999. This number is assigned to the variable improvedNum.
        <br />
        3. Rounds the value represented by improvedNum down to the nearest
        integer that ranges <br />
        from 1 through 6. <br />

      <h1>-: Converting strings to integers and decimals :-</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        Sometimes JavaScript seems to read your mind. For example, suppose you
        write... <br />
        var currentAge = prompt("Enter your age."); <br />
        ...JavaScript assigns the user's answer to currentAge as a string. Her
        entry, let's say <br />32, may look like a number to you, but to
        JavaScript it's a string: "32". <br />
        Nevertheless, suppose you write... <br />
        1 var currentAge = prompt("Enter your age."); <br />
        2 var yearsEligibleToVote = currentAge - 18; <br />
        In the above code, the value assigned to the variable currentAge is a
        string, because it <br />
        comes from a user's prompt response. But in line 2, when the variable
        appears in an arithmetic <br />
        expression, the value is automatically (and temporarily) converted to a
        number to make the <br />
        math work. <br />
        Similarly, if you ask JavaScript to divide "100" by 2 or multiply "2.5"
        by 2.5, JavaScri <br />pt seems to understand that you want the string
        treated as a number, and does the math. You <br />
        can even ask JavaScript to multiply, divide, or subtract using nothing
        but strings as terms, <br />
        and JavaScript, interpreting your intentions correctly, does the math.
        <br />
        var profit = "200" - "150"; <br />
        In the statement above, the two strings are treated as numbers because
        they appear in a <br />
        math expression. The variable profit, in spite of the quotation marks,
        is assigned the number <br />
        It probably goes without saying that the string you ask JavaScript to do
        math on has to be <br />
        a number contained in quotes, like "50", not letter characters. If you
        write... <br />
        var profit = "200" - "duck"; <br />
        ...an alert will display saying "NaN" meaning "not a number." No mystery
        here. How can <br />
        200 minus "duck" be a number? <br />
        You may recall from a previous chapter that when you mix strings and
        numbers in an <br />
        expression involving a plus, JavaScript does the opposite of what you
        see in the examples <br />
        above. Rather than converting strings to numbers, JavaScript converts
        numbers to strings. <br />
        Rather than adding, it concatenates. <br />
        var result = "200" + 150; <br />
        In the statement above, JavaScript, seeing the string "200" and the
        number 150, resolves <br />
        the conflict by converting 150 to a string: "150". Then it concatenates
        the two strings. The<br />
        variable result is assigned "200150". If the + in the expression were
        one of the other <br />
        arithmetic operators(-, *, or /), JavaScript would convert the string
        "200" to the number 200 <br />
        and do the math. <br />
        You can see there's going to be a problem with the following code.
        <br />
        1 var currentAge = prompt("Enter your age."); <br />
        2 var qualifying Age = currentAge + 1; <br />
        The code above has an unintended consequence. The string represented by
        currentAge is <br />
        concatenated with 1 that has been converted to "1". Example: if the user
        enters "52," <br />
        qualifyingAge is assigned not 53 but "521". <br />
        If you want to do addition, you must convert any strings to numbers.
        <br />
        1 var currentAge = prompt("Enter your age."); <br />
        2 var qualifyingAge = parseInt(currentAge) + 1; <br />
        Line 2 converts the string represented by currentAge to a number before
        adding 1 to it <br />
        and assigning the sum to qualifyingAge. <br />
        parseInt converts all strings, including strings comprising
        floating-point numbers, to <br />
        integers. And shocking but true: It it doesn't round. It simply lops off
        the decimals. In the <br />
        following statement, myInteger is assigned not 2 as you might expect,
        but 1. <br />
        var myInteger = parseInt("1.9999"); <br />
        To preserve any decimal values, use parseFloat. In the following
        statement <br />
        myFractional is assigned 1.9999. <br />
        var myFractional = parseFloat("1.9999"); <br />
        To minimize confusion, coders sometimes prefer to do explicit, manual
        conversions even <br />
        when JavaScript doesn't require them, as in mixing a string and a number
        in a multiplication <br />
        operation. <br />

      <p class="ali">
        In the last chapter you learned to use parseInt to convert a string
        representing a number <br />
        into an integer. And you learned to use parseFloat to convert a string
        representing a number <br />
        into a floating-point number. You can finesse the distinction between
        integers and floatingpoint <br />numbers by using Number. This handy
        conversion tool converts a string representing <br />
        either an integer or a floating-point number to a number that's
        identical to the one inside the <br />
        parentheses. <br />
        The following code converts the string "24" to the number 24. <br />
        1 var integerString = "24" <br />
        2 var num = Number(integerString); <br />
        The following code converts the string "24.9876" to the number 24.9876.
        <br />
        1 var floatingNumString = "24.9876"; <br />
        2 var num = Number(floatingNumString); <br />
        Suppose your code has done an arithmetic calculation that yielded a big
        number. Now you <br />
        want to present the result of the calculation to your user. But before
        you display the number, <br />
        you want to format it with commas so it's readable. In order to do that,
        you'll have to convert <br />
        the number to a string. This is how you do it. <br />
        Converting a number to a string, perhaps so you can format it, is
        straightforward. <br />
        1 var numberAsNumber = 1234; <br />
        2 var numberAsString = numberAsNumber.toString(); <br />
        The code above converts the number 1234 to the string "1234" and assigns
        it to the <br />
        variable numberAsString. <br />

      <h1>-: Controlling the length of decimals :-</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        The price of the item is $9.95. The sales tax is 6.5% of the price. You
        combine the two <br />
        numbers to get the total. <br />
        var total = price + (price * taxRate); <br />
        The variable total now has a value of 10.59675. <br />
        But that isn't what you're going to charge the customer, is it? You're
        going to charge her an<br />
        amount rounded off to two decimal places: $10.60. <br />
        Here's how to do it. <br />
        var prettyTotal = total.toFixed(2); <br />
        The statement above rounds the number represented by total to 2 places
        and assigns the <br />
        result to the variable prettyTotal. The number inside the parentheses
        tells JavaScript how<br />
        many places to round the decimal to. <br />
        Now add a dollar sign, and you're all set. <br />
        var currencyTotal = "$" + prettyTotal; <br />
        To shorten a number to no decimals, leave the parentheses empty. <br />
        var prettyTotal = total.toFixed(); <br />
        Unfortunately, the toFixed method comes with a surprise inside. If a
        decimal ends in 5, it<br />
        usually rounds up, as you would expect. But, depending on the browser,
        sometimes it rou nds<br />
        down! If, for example, you apply the method to 1.555, specifying 2
        decimal places, it may give<br />
        you "1.56". Or it may produce "1.55". <br />
        There are sophisticated ways to address the problem. Here's an inelegant
        fix that uses <br />
        methods you already know and understand. <br />
        1 var str = num.toString(); <br />
        2 if (str.charAt(str.length - 1) === "5") { <br />
        3 str = str.slice(0, str.length - 1) + "6"; <br />
        4 } <br />
        5 num = Number(str); <br />
        6 prettyNum = num.toFixed(2); <br />
        If the decimal ends in a 5, the code changes it to a 6 so the method is
        forced to round up<br />
        when it should. Here's what's happening, line-by-line: <br />
        1. Converts the number to a string and assigns it to the variable str.
        <br />
        2. Checks to see if the last character is "5". <br />
        3. If so, slices off the "5" and appends "6". <br />
        4. -- <br />
        5. Converts it back to a number. <br />
        6. Rounds it to 2 places. <br />
